                <h1>History of Islam</h1>
                <p>
                    Islam is one of the world’s major monotheistic religions, with over a billion followers known as
                    Muslims. It emerged in
                    the Arabian Peninsula in the 7th century AD and is based on the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad,
                    who is considered the
                    last and final messenger of God in a line of prophets that includes figures like Adam, Abraham,
                    Moses, and Jesus.

                    To understand the history and origin of Islam, World History Edu explores the socio-political and
                    religious context of
                    Arabia before Islam, the life of Prophet Muhammad, the revelation of the Quran, and the early
                    expansion of Islam.

                <p>"The Life of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ"
                    Prophet Muhammad ﷺ was born in the city of Makkah around 570 AD, into the respected Quraysh tribe.
                    He was known for his
                    honesty and was called "Al-Amin" (the trustworthy) by his people. At the age of 40, he began
                    receiving divine
                    revelations through the Angel Jibreel (Gabriel), which were later compiled into the Quran. His
                    message emphasized the
                    oneness of God (Tawheed), social justice, compassion, and moral conduct.
